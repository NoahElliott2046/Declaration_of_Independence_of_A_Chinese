# Declaration of Independence

### Preface

Since the beginning of 19th century, the Chinese people have never given up the attempt of seeking for freedom, independence, democracy, and a life of dignity. The willingness of building a peaceful, successful and respectable country has never been so strong than ever. However, this attempt and willingness is always utterly suppressed and absolutely betrayed by a totalitarian regime which has been slaving us for nearly a century. Its name is called Chinese Communist Party(CCP[^1]).

### Accusation

Under the rule of CCP[^1], the history of this country, Peopleâ€™s Republic of China(PRC[^2]), is simply a history full of cheat, abuse, violence, domination and persecutions, not only for Chinese people, but also for the entire human race. Below lists some of the accusations:

- They(CCP[^1]) spread Communism, Nazism and Terrorism which ruined our values, believes, traditions, culture, education, spirit, faith and every piece of good things existed in our land.
- For decades, they have been sucking incredible fortune from the population, not even miss the poorest and weakest ones, only to reinforce their dictatorship and slavery against us.
- They brain-wash our minds, manipulate our lives, spread hatred and terrorize the communities. They silence journalists, prison lawyers, disappear objectors and commit genocide. They conduct all these national crimes to such an extreme that no one has ever seen in the human history.
- They released COVID-19, a man-made virus[^3] which proved to be one of the un-restricted bio weapons[^4] developed by People's Liberation Army(PLA[^5]). So far, it caused the death of millions of innocent people all around the world.
- Countless humanitarian disasters are fabricated by the current government and its chairman Xi Jin Ping, who apparently plot to decivilize, imperialize and weaponize the whole nation.

### Announcement

Based on the facts above, I, from today, take back all the rights and privileges which I had somehow given to the government of People's Republic China for conducting the power as governor. They are no longer authorized to act as representative of me in any aspect, no matter politically or privately, mentally or physically, geographically or historically.  

From today, I terminate all political connections and relationships with the government of People's Republic China and Chinese Communist Party. I do not admit that their power serves public and their law serves justice. Nor do I have any obligation to pay them tax, insurance or any other outrageous charges which only aims to support their dictatorship and conduct national crimes.

From today, I am no longer a slave being manipulated by this evil Communist regime. 

From today, I go free.
